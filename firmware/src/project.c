/* Projects: four slots. The slots live in .noinit RAM: they
 * survive resets and UBOOT entry. With FELUCCA_FLASH (default) every save
 * also goes to flash through storage.c, and an
 * empty RAM slot is filled from flash on load.
 *
 * Format 7 ("FUN7", written) stores P_COUNT (byte 66) and maps an older count as user presets do: FUN7 of
 * 89 parameters (before the chord keys P_CHRD / P_VOIC) loads its engine values at today's P_E0..P_E7,
 * the chord keys OFF / CLOSE, and its motion events' ids from its P_E0 on move up with them (proj_motion_ids).
 * 68 + 4 x (91 + 2 + 64 x 9) + chain + motion = 3040 of the 3372 bytes before the name: 332 spare, room for
 * 83 more track parameters (4 bytes each).
 * (V10.6s) FUN1 .. FUN6 (Felucca betas to 1.0.2) are retired: such a project is refused (not a project, as a
 * damaged one), never half read. So is what only they needed: the GM drum part of track 4 before 1.0 (`parts` 0),
 * the PHYS MODEL DUST / DRUM of before 1.0 (`phys`, written PROJ_PHYS, read by none) and SAMPLE's PERC set in a
 * project (it plays as ANALOG's first, as SAMPLE does: proj_phys_gone).
 *
 * Format 8 ("FUN8", written since 1.0) = FUN7 with each track's FM6 patch (eng_fm6.c, the 128-byte packed
 * record, 4 x 128 bytes just before the name): a project is self-contained. On load an FM6 track's SLOT shows F n
 * when its patch is that factory one, else OWN (eng_fm6.c fm6_adopt; a stored 8..34, the B slots of the patch bank
 * before 1.0.3, is OWN too: the project has the patch).
 * It is 3584 bytes (FUN7: 3388); FUN7 is read (its tracks get the init patch). The retained cache (proj_slot,
 * .noinit) grew with it: after an update its slot 1 still starts with a FUN7 record, which is read; the other
 * slots fail their hash and come back from flash (persist_boot).
 *
 * Format 9 ("FUN9", written since 1.1) = FUN8 with 64 more bytes: the DRUM lane levels (P_LN0..P_LN7, #97) made
 * P_COUNT 99 (P_E0 91), and 68 + 4 x (99 + 2 + 576) + chain + motion = 3072 no longer fit before FUN8's patches
 * (3056). 3648 bytes, the patches at PROJ_FM6_OFF (3120): 48 spare, room for 12 more track parameters. FUN8 (3584,
 * its 91 parameters mapped by count: the lane levels 100 %) and FUN7 are read; the retained cache grew again (its
 * slot 1 still starts with the older record, read as above).
 *
 * Format A ("FUNA", written since JIANT 0.1) = FUN9 with 96 more bytes: the section's DRUM-X kit (drumx_voice.c
 * dx_lane_t[8], 88 bytes, then the group mutes, the sounds' mutes (dx_mute, 2 bytes), 1 = the SHIFT offsets (P_SOFS P_POFS, once the chord keys: 0 before it) and 5 reserved, written 0) at PROJ_DX_OFF, just before the FM6 patches. 3744 bytes (a
 * flash object holds 3840); the serialized part still ends by 3120 (FUN9's 48 spare bytes stay). FUN9 is read
 * (its kit: the factory one, DX_KIT_DEF), as every older format. JIANT 0.1 also keeps the punch-in lane (pfx.c) in
 * the 48 spare bytes before the kit: 64 nibbles at PROJ_PFX_OFF (3072), its tracks at 3104 (a FUN9 or an earlier
 * FUNA has zeros there: no lane), and the macros M1..M4 (mod.c macro_v, one byte each) right after, at 3105.
 *
 * Format B ("FUNB", written since JIANT 0.2) = FUNA with 96 more bytes (3840: a flash object's whole payload): 21 track
 * parameters before P_E0 (DIST TYPE TONE, the modulation sequence's LEN DIV SLEW and 16 levels: P_COUNT 120, P_E0 112; JIANT 0.5: the FILTER TYPE CUT RES, 123 and 115, no spare byte left),
 * so the data ends at 3156 and everything after it moved up by 96 (the punch-in block at PROJ_PFX_OFF 3168, the kit at
 * 3216); and nine globals past the header's 27 (G_DHPF .. G_DSPRY) after the macros: a 2 at PROJ_GX_OFF (1: the
 * first five, G_DHPF .. G_RPRE, saved by JIANT 0.2), then biased
 * bytes. FUNA (99 parameters, no new globals) and older load mapped by count, the new values their defaults.
 *
 * Parameter locks (1.1, core.h MOTION_LOCK) are motion records with bit 7 of their id byte set (P_COUNT 99 < 128:
 * the bit is free): no byte moved for them, and every project before 1.1 has none. FUN9 holds them. A FUN8 / FUN7
 * record of a 1.1 development build may hold some: on load their ids move to today's positions as the others do,
 * the lock bit kept (proj_motion_ids). Firmware before 1.1 refuses a project that holds a lock (an id out of its
 * range), as with RATCH below; FUN9 it refuses anyway (a newer format).
 *
 * A step's RATCH (core.h SF_RATCH, the hits - 1, 0..3) is in bit 7 of its velocity byte (bit 0) and of its chance
 * byte (bit 1) of FUN7 / FUN8: bits every firmware before wrote 0, so every older project loads with its steps x1,
 * and no format or size changed. Firmware before RATCH refuses a project that holds a ratchet (those bytes out
 * of their range), as it would a newer format.
 *
 * DIGITAL (engine 1) was retired in 1.0 (fm4_convert.c): a track of it, in any format, loads as FM6 with the
 * patch converted from its values as the track's own (proj_fm4, on every import; the stored record keeps what it
 * holds until saved again). Its motion events on the EDIT or OP ENV values are dropped.
 *
 * (JIANT 0.8.5) VOICE's lyrics (sing.c lyr_txt): each track's that is not empty, in FUNC's block 'L' 'Y' after the
 * others (track, length, its ASCII 32..126: 4 + length bytes; proj_packed_size counts it). A project without it (any
 * before 0.8.5, any format) loads with no lyrics; firmware before 0.8.5 stops reading at the block (it reads the
 * blocks it knows, in order, and this one comes last), so the rest of such a project loads there as before.
 *
 * Built on the Mac too (tests/project_test.c, -DPROJ_HOST): the part above the #ifndef
 * PROJ_HOST needs core.h, params.c (TP) and engines.c. */
