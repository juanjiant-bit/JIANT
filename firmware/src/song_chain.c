/* The song (docs/TONIC-SONG-PLAN.md). Four sections A..D, the four saved projects: a section is the whole project, the
 * four tracks' sounds (engine, parameters, FM6 patch), the DRUM-X kit, their steps and the motion; the tempo and the
 * globals are the song's (not the sections'). Sections go in on the bar (a 4/4 bar of 16 1/16 steps at the tempo), every track from
 * its step 0, the remainder of the block carried.
 *   the song    up to CHAIN_ROWS rows, each a section and the bars it plays (1..CHAIN_BARS): PLAY on SONG (or anywhere
 *               in SONG mode) plays it from the top and keeps the music as it was (song_keep), which comes back when
 *               the song ends (its last row) or stops
 *   live        (the song layer, SAVE held: ui_layer.c) a section asked for while the loop plays goes in on the next
 *               bar (stopped: at once); the music can be stored into a section (RAM at once, flash once stopped) and
 *               the section playing brought back as it was stored (RECALL); a quick chain (two or more sections
 *               tapped in one hold) plays them in turn, each its longest pattern's bars, round and round; SONG REC
 *               writes the sections played and their bars into the song's rows
 *   main loop   decodes the section that goes in next into sec_stage (song_main.c); the ISR only swaps it in
 *               (song_play.c). A row whose section is not staged in time plays its section another bar
 * This file: the state and the rows; song_play.c (included at the end of seq.c): the ISR's part; song_main.c
 * (included by project.c): the main loop's. */
