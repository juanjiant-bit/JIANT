 * as the IMAGE of DRUM-X and the poly synths keep theirs: the part's mono sum through its chain, each side what it gives
 * up, eng_drum.c dx_sl / dx_sr). Two INPUT tracks can take IN 1 and IN 2 each. Then GAIN, GATE (a noise gate: closed
 * below its level), BITS and RATE (fewer bits, a lower rate: held samples), and the track's own chain as any part's:
 * FILTER, DIST, LEVEL, PAN, the sends, the mutes, the matrix. PLAY: THRU sounds it all the time; KEYS only while a
 * note plays, at the note's envelope (VOICE: ATK DEC SUS REL; the sequencer's steps gate it: a trance gate), RING then
 * multiplying it by a sine at the note's pitch. WIDTH: STEREO's width.
 *
 * While a track is INPUT the input goes to it alone (fx.c mix_part: the last live track's USB IN+OUT mix steps aside).
 * The FOLLOW source of the matrix (mod.c MS_FOLLOW) is the input's envelope, whatever track takes it. */
