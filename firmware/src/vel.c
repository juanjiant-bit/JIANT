/* (V10.6z6) Key velocity and pressure: stage 2 of the velocity diagnostic (vel_diag.c), after Velo (Charles Vestal,
 * github.com/charlesvestal/fm1-velocity, GPL-3.0: the drive and the reading of the carbon pill are his findings).
 * The 20 keys F3..C5 (rows PA7 / PA8); the top row C#5..G5 has no converter and plays the mean of the recent velocities.
 *
 * The strike (vd_sample, the scan's ISR): a key touched is sampled every 2.2 ms, every other sample with its row driven
 * high; its velocity comes from the lowest driven reading of an early window: from the touch to the first driven sample
 * after the key seated, or after its press was debounced, whichever comes first (the owner's two captures,
 * docs/VELOCITY_DIAG.es.md: the minimum in an early window is the reliable measure, lower = harder; a sample that
 * catches the key still falling reads high). The digital scan debounces a press 1.1..2.2 ms after its contact closes;
 * a press whose window is still open then waits (vel_note_on: its bit held back from the keys' block, vk_hold) and its
 * key's next sample is taken driven: the window closes there, at most one sample period later. (V10.7.10, a user: "drums
 * almost impossible to use") The wait is capped in scan ticks, not in samples: VK_WAIT_T (22 ticks, 2.2 ms) after the
 * debounce the press plays whatever its readings did (a conversion that timed out, fm1_an.timeouts, drops its reading:
 * before, the wait then ran on to the key's next one, 4.4 ms or more), with the velocity so far, else the key's recent
 * mean (vel_tick). A key whose touch has not been sampled yet waits the same. A key going to a DRUM track (seq.c
 * kb_drum_keys, as keyboard_block routes it: the selected track or KEY SPLIT's half; the DRUM grid) never waits: it
 * plays at its debounce with the velocity read so far, else its recent mean; its strike is still read and learnt.
 * tests/vel_test.c: 400 modelled presses, with conversions timing out and with none at all: the wait never over 2.2 ms;
 * on a DRUM track none. No setting: the synth tracks keep the (capped) wait. The pressure's zero is the lowest driven
 * reading once seated.
 *
 * The velocity (vel_map), continuous: each key keeps three references, its HARD, NORMAL and SOFT strikes (vs.ref);
 * the strike's reading maps piecewise-linearly through them, HARD 112, NORMAL 76, SOFT 36, on at half the slope past
 * either end (clamped 1..127); then MENU > CONTROL > VELOCITY's curve (SOFT: louder for less, v + v (127 - v) / 254;
 * NORMAL as it is; HARD: v - v (127 - v) / 254) and VEL MIN's floor (1..127 scaled onto MIN..127, no step).
 * VELOCITY OFF: every key 100, as before V10.6z6 (and with AFTERTOUCH OFF too the scan samples nothing: bit for bit).
 *
 * The calibration (vel_lift, at the key's release; MENU > CONTROL > VEL LEARN ON, the default): each seated strike's
 * reading (the one its velocity came from) moves the key's references a step towards its own running quantiles, sign steps that no freak strike can throw (HARD the
 * 15th percentile: down 34 / up 6 sixteenths of a count; NORMAL the median, 16 / 16; SOFT the 85th, up 34 / down 6;
 * four times that for a key's first 24 strikes after a reset), kept at least 8 (HARD..NORMAL) and 16 (NORMAL..SOFT)
 * counts apart. Seeded from the owner's measured medians (HARD 560, NORMAL 594, SOFT 675, DRIVE 2) moved by each key's
 * offset where the captures had it (VC_OFS: its mean against the others'). Kept in the settings (favorites row 4, the
 * retired SAMPLE engine's: no engine reads it; 12 bits a key, NORMAL 400..904 by 8, SOFT - NORMAL 16..128 by 16,
 * NORMAL - HARD 8..64 by 8), written 30 s after the last strike learnt with no key held and the transport
 * stopped (project.c settings_poll waits for that, as for any setting); VEL LEARN RESET puts the seeds back.
 *
 * The pressure (vel_driven; MENU > CONTROL > AFTERTOUCH LOW / MID / HIGH, MID the default; OFF none): a held key's
 * driven reading under its strike, past a dead zone (a finger resting does not move it): (strike - reading) x 1 / 2 / 4
 * - 16, 0..127 (the dead zone 16 / 8 / 4 counts, full pressure 143 / 72 / 36 counts under the strike); smoothed a
 * quarter of the way a driven sample (~18 ms), 0 when the key is let go. seq.c kx_block: a track's is its held keys'
 * highest, slewed, into the matrix's AT. */
