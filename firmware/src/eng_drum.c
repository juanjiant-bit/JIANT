/* DRUM: JIANT's drum engine, DRUM-X (drumx_voice.c, after Sonic Charge's Microtonic): a kit of 8 lanes, KICK, SNARE,
 * CLAP, HAT CL, HAT OP, TOM, RIM, BELL, each a synthesized sound with two patches A and B and a MORPH between them.
 * The kit is the section's (drumx_voice.c dx_kit), edited on EDIT > SOUND. Felucca's DRUM kits (STD and the model
 * kits 80 10 66 55 77, drum_voice.c) were retired in JIANT 0.1: a sound or project that picked one plays DRUM-X.
 * Before Felucca 1.0 this engine was PHYS's MODEL DRUM; those sounds load as it (drum_from_phys in core.h).
 *
 * Keys and notes: the keys play the General MIDI drum map with the kick on the first C (C KICK, C# RIM,
 * D SNARE, D# CLAP, F# HAT CL, A# HAT OP, F G A B C D TOMS, C# CYM, G# BELL; OCT -/+ move it), and a note
 * plays its GM drum on its lane (35..81: kicks, snares, toms, hats, cymbals and bells on BELL, congas on TOM, claves
 * on RIM, each at its pitch from the lane's; other notes as their octave of 36..47), so GM patterns and MIDI parts
 * play as drums.
 *
 * Parameters (stored as before: KIT's slot is MRPH, SNAP's NOIS, KICK's WARP): MRPH the MORPH A..B of every
 * lane; TUNE (+-12 semitones), TONE (COLOR), DECY (DECAY) and NOIS (NOISE) move every lane from its patch (64: as
 * the kit has it); FM (JIANT, once ACC) every sound through harmonic FM, eight ratio bands (drumx_voice.c dx_run); FOLD (JIANT 0.5, was WARP) every sound's oscillator through a wavefolder after its envelope: a bright attack folding back to the plain tail (0: as the kit has it); DRV a soft clip on every hit
 * (x1..x4, level kept). Each lane has its LEVEL (P_LN0..P_LN7, EDIT > LANES / LANES 2, #97: square law, 100 % the
 * default) on the voice amplitude after the knee. The knobs move a hit while it rings.
 *
 * Polyphony: a lane per drum and part, mono: a hit reuses its lane's voice even at another pitch, the 8 lanes ring
 * together. A sounding voice plays one lane (s[0]); the lane remembers its voice (owner), and a voice
 * whose lane was struck again by another voice, or has rung out (-84 dB), ends itself (drum_amp). The
 * voices come from the shared budget (voice.c), up to 8 per part. A closed hat chokes the open one.
 *
 * What applies (engine_t.oneshot): the hit is the envelope. VOICE (always POLY), GLIDE, the ADSR, ENV DEST,
 * LFO DEST PIT / FLT / SHP, the global TUNE and the matrix's PITCH CUT SHP do nothing; LEVEL, PAN, the
 * sends, DIST, the SLICER, LFO DEST AMP, velocity, the matrix's AMP and its E1..E8 (the knobs, per
 * block) do. A released key does not end a hit.
 *
 * State: 8 lanes per part in the pool section (drum_kit: each lane's hit). */
