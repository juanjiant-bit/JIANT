/* A DRUM-X sound (a lane of a kit) is dx_lane_t, 11 bytes: the mode and five values for each of its patches A and B:
 *   PITCH  the oscillator, MIDI 24..119 (33 Hz .. 7.9 kHz), 3/4 semitone a step
 *   PMOD   the pitch envelope: up to +4 octaves at the hit, falling with a sixth of the decay's tau (1..40 ms)
 *   DECAY  the amplitude's tau, 3 ms .. 1.5 s (exponential)
 *   NOISE  the mix: 0 the oscillator only .. 127 the noise only
 *   COLOR  the oscillator's FM index (SINE: its drive) and the noise filter's cutoff (30 Hz .. 16 kHz)
 * The mode: the oscillator (SINE, FM at 1:1, METAL at 1:1.47, BELL at 1:2.76), the noise filter (LP, BP, HP), the
 * noise's envelope (as the oscillator's, or SNAP: a quarter of its tau); (JIANT 0.4, the mode's free bits 5..7) the
 * pitch modulation, as Microtonic's: DECAY (the envelope above), LONG (its tau half the decay's, up to 250 ms: the
 * 808 boom), NOISE (a random pitch each block, scaled by the envelope: glitch, grit), SINE (a sine at 1/8 of the
 * pitch, scaled by the envelope: wobble, laser); and DRIVE (the oscillator x3 into a soft clip: dense kicks, fat toms).
 * MORPH (0 A .. 127 B) mixes the two patches value by value, read every block: it may move while a hit rings.
 * Envelopes per block (Q30 values, Q16 factors, dv_kb), ramped linearly inside it; the pitch ramps too. A hit
 * that has rung out (-84 dB) stops computing (live 0) and writes zeros. Only 32-bit products. */
