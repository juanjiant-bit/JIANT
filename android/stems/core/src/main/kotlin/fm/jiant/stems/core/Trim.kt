// JVM tests can drag them. 1.0 took a touch anywhere within 22 dp of an edge, on any lane, as a grab, and moved the edge
// to the finger at the first jitter: a tap near the end to move the playhead cut the take short, and an edge dragged to
// the screen's end stopped short of the take's end (the last pixel is not the last frame). Now: an edge is taken by its
// grip in the ruler, or on a lane only right at its line; it moves with the finger from where it was taken (no jump),
// only once the finger has really moved; within a few pixels of either end of the timeline it is the end exactly.
