 *              (until 0.9.7 its dry sound was in its stem and again, sliced, in the FX return); FX ON: in the FX return;
 *   ECO        its tail trimming (the load budget, LOAD tight) and the shared voice cap act on the take itself: the stems
 *              keep exactly what the mix plays (they null against the solo render of the same take), however many voices
