"""Shared rasteriser of the UI fonts and icons (gen_aa_font.py, gen_aa_icons.py).

TTF -> trimmed 4-bit alpha bitmaps. Pillow + FreeType (+ Raqm for kerning and OpenType features);
fontTools is not needed here. Nothing is downloaded, nothing is installed.

Bitmap format (shared by glyphs and icons)
  alpha 0..15, row-major, 2 pixels per byte (high nibble first), rows packed back to back
  (no padding between rows), every bitmap starts on a byte boundary.
  A glyph is trimmed to its ink box (bw x bh); an icon is a square cell (no trimming).

Glyphs are drawn at 16 x the size and box-filtered down (unhinted area coverage), once per horizontal phase:
FreeType's grid fitting at the small size snapped each glyph's stems and bowls to whole pixels on its own and
moved it up to 0.8 px off its fractional advance, which made the space between round and straight letters
uneven (text_spacing_test.py measures it).

    1/16 px, so text width is exact over a string. phases: horizontal positions rasterised per glyph (1, 2, 4):
    phase p is the glyph drawn at a pen of +p/phases px; src/gfx.c cv_text takes one of the two phase positions
    around the pen, so a glyph sits less than a step (1/phases px) from its true place and neighbours keep their
    space within about half a step. The FIXED characters have one phase and sit at the rounded pen: a number
    drawn a character at a time at its rounded pens (the rolling digits) then lands exactly where the whole
    string does; with tabular, the WHOLE ones also advance by whole pixels, so a number has no rounding at all.
    tracking: extra advance per glyph in em (negative = tighter; the stand-in for "Inter Tight").
