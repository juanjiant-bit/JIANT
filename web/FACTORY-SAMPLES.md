# JIANT factory sample bank 1

Twelve new synthetic mono recordings, 5406 bytes including the 256-byte header after IMA ADPCM encoding. The bank fits SAMPLE's 6144-byte bank without truncating any slot. The JSON lives on the website; nothing is embedded in the firmware image. Audio recordings are dedicated to the public domain under CC0-1.0. The generator source is GPL-3.0-only, like JIANT.

Piano and flute are new syntheses, not recordings copied from an unverified CC0 library. Every sound is normalized and faded at its edges. The generator is `tools/gen_factory_samples.c`; build/run instructions are at its top. `web/test_sampler.mjs` packs this JSON through the editor's actual encoder. `tests/factory_bank_test.c` then transfers, indexes and plays every slot through the firmware's real C sampler.

In the editor, **Load factory samples** stages the bank locally. Review the list, then **Send to the device** confirms replacement of all stored samples. Use SAMPLE's **KIT KEYS** preset to play slots across the keyboard. Loading a bank does not automatically change tracks or their selected preset. Keep the original WAV files: project backups currently do not contain SAMPLE's audio bank. Neither the editor nor the installer writes these factory samples automatically.
